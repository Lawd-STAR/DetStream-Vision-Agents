We use pytest for testing. Be sure to mark integration tests with @pytest.mark.integration
Async is automatic, no need to tag that.
Keep tests short and don't use mocking unless explicitly asked to use mocks.

This project uses `uv` to manage Python and its dependencies so when you run tests, make sure to use `uv run pytest` and not python -m

Extend from BaseTest

Store data for fixtures in tests/test_assets/...

Non-blocking checks

- TTS plugins must not block the event loop inside `stream_audio`. Use the helper in `vision_agents.core.tts.testing`:

  ```python
  from vision_agents.core.tts.testing import assert_tts_send_non_blocking

  @pytest.mark.integration
  async def test_tts_non_blocking(tts):
      await assert_tts_send_non_blocking(tts, "Hello")
  ```
