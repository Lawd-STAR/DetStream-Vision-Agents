## Overview

## To install:

In the project root, run:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12.11
uv sync --all-extras --dev
pre-commit install
```

To setup your .env
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

## Running
```bash
uv run examples/01_simple_agent_example/simple_agent_example.py
```

## Tests

Everything other than integration tests

```
uv run py.test -m "not integration" -n auto
```

Integration test. (requires secrets in place, see .env setup)
```
uv run py.test -m "integration" -n auto
```

Plugin tests (TODO: not quite right. uv env is different for each plugin)

```
uv run py.test plugins/*/tests/*.py -m "not integration"
```

### Check

Shortcut to ruff, mypy and non integration tests:

```
uv run python dev.py check
```

### Formatting

```
uv run ruff check --fix
```

### Mypy type checks


```
uv run mypy --install-types --non-interactive -p vision_agents
```

```
uv run mypy --install-types --non-interactive --exclude 'plugins/.*/tests/.*' plugins
```

## Release

Create a new release on Github, CI handles the rest. If you do need to do it manually follow these instructions:

```
rm -rf dist
git tag v0.0.15
uv run hatch version # this should show the right version
git push origin main --tags
uv build --all
uv publish
```

Common issues. If you have local changes (or ran build before you had the tag) you'll get this error

```
  Caused by: Upload failed with status code 400 Bad Request. Server says: 400 The use of local versions in <Version('0.0.16.dev0+gc7563254f.d20251008')> is not allowed. See https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata for more information.
```

## Architecture

To see how the agent work open up agents.py

### STT & TTS flow

* The agent listens to AudioReceivedEvent and forwards that to STT.
* STT then fires the STTPartialTranscriptEvent and STTTranscriptEvent event.
* The agent receives this event and calls agent.llm.simple_response.
* The LLM triggers LLMResponseEvent, and the agent calls
* await self.tts.send(llm_response.text)

### Realtime STS flow

**Audio**

* The agent listens to AudioReceivedEvent and calls simple_audio_response
* asyncio.create_task(self.llm.simple_audio_response(pcm_data))
* The STS writes on agent.llm.audio_track

**Video**

* The agent receives the video track, and calls agent.llm._watch_video_track
* The LLM uses the VideoForwarder to write the video to a websocket or webrtc connection
* The STS writes the reply on agent.llm.audio_track and the RealtimeTranscriptEvent / RealtimePartialTranscriptEvent

## Audio management

Some important things about audio inside the library:

1. WebRTC uses Opus 48khz stereo but inside the library audio is always in PCM format
2. Plugins / AI models work with different PCM formats, usually 16khz mono
3. PCM data is always passed around using the `PcmData` object which contains information about sample rate, channels and format
4. Text-to-speech plugins automatically return PCM in the format needed by WebRTC. This is exposed via the `set_output_format` method
5. Audio resampling can be done using `PcmData.resample` method
6. When resampling audio in chunks, it is important to re-use the same `av.AudioResampler` resampler (see `PcmData.resample` and `core.tts.TTS`)
7. Adjusting from stereo to mono and vice-versa can be done using the `PcmData.resample` method

Some ground rules:

1. Do not build code to resample / adjust audio unless it is not covered already by `PcmData`
2. Do not pass PCM as plain bytes around and write code that assumes specific sample rate or format. Use `PcmData` instead

## Example

```python
import asyncio
from getstream.video.rtc.track_util import PcmData
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

async def example():
    client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key="sk-42")

    resp = await client.audio.speech.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini-tts",
        voice="alloy",
        input="pcm is cool, give me some of that please",
        response_format="pcm",
    )

    # load response into PcmData, note that you need to specify sample_rate, channels and format
    pcm_data = PcmData.from_bytes(
        resp.content, sample_rate=24_000, channels=1, format="s16"
    )

    # check if pcm_data is stereo (it's not in this case ofc)
    print(pcm_data.stereo)

    # write the pcm to file
    with open("test.wav", "wb") as f:
        f.write(pcm_data.to_wav_bytes())

    # resample pcm to be 48khz stereo
    resampled_pcm = pcm_data.resample(48_000, 2)

    # play-out pcm using ffplay
    from vision_agents.core.edge.types import play_pcm_with_ffplay

    await play_pcm_with_ffplay(resampled_pcm)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(example())
```

Other things that you get from the audio utilities:

1. Changing PCM format
2. Iterate over audio chunks (`PcmData.chunks`)
3. Process audio with pre/post buffers (`AudioSegmentCollector`)
4. Accumulating audio (`PcmData.append`)

### Testing audio manually

Sometimes you need to test audio manually, here's some tips:

1. Do not use earplugs when testing PCM playback ;)
2. You can use the `PcmData.to_wav_bytes` method to convert PCM into wav bytes (see `manual_tts_to_wav` for an example)
3. If you have `ffplay` installed, you can playback pcm directly to check if audio is correct

## Dev / Contributor Guidelines

### Light wrapping

AI is changing daily. This makes it important to use light wrapping. IE

```python
tts = ElevenLabsTTS(client=ElevenLabs())
```

Note how the ElevenLabsTTS handles standardization.
But if the init for ElevenLabs changes, nothing breaks.
If features are added to the client, you can use them easily via tts.client

### Typing

Avoid using Union types or complicated composite types.
Keep typing simple. Use the `getstream.video.rtc.track_util.PcmData` type instead of bytes when passing around audio.
This prevents mistakes related to handling audio with different formats, sample rates etc.

### Testing

Many of the underlying APIs change daily. To ensure things work we keep 2 sets of tests. Integration tests and unit tests.
Integration tests run once a day to verify that changes to underlying APIs didn't break the framework. Some testing guidelines

- Every plugin needs an integration test
- Limit usage of response capturing style testing. (since they diverge from reality)

### Observability

- Traces and metrics go to Prometheus and OpenTelemetry
- Metrics on performance of TTS, STT, LLM, Turn detection and connection to realtime edge.
- Integration with external LLM observability solutions

#### Example setup for tracing and Jaeger:

**Step 1 - Install open telemetry OTLP exporter**

```bash
# with uv:
uv install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp

# or with pip:
pip install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc
`````

**Step 2 - Setup tracing instrumentation in your code**

Make sure to setup the instrumentation before you start the agent/server

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

resource = Resource.create(
    {
        "service.name": "agents",
    }
)
tp = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="localhost:4317", insecure=True)

tp.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(exporter))
trace.set_tracer_provider(tp)
```

**Step 3 - Run Jaeger**

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
         -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
         -p 16686:16686 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 \
         jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.51```
```

After this, you can run your code and see the traces in Jaeger at `http://localhost:16686`

#### Example setup for metrics with Prometheus:

**Step 1 - Install prometheus exporter**

```bash
# with uv:
uv install opentelemetry-exporter-prometheus prometheus-client

# or with pip:
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-prometheus prometheus-client
```

**Step 2 - Setup metrics instrumentation in your code**

Make sure to setup the instrumentation before you start the agent/server

```python
from opentelemetry import metrics
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.exporter.prometheus import PrometheusMetricReader
from prometheus_client import start_http_server

resource = Resource.create(
    {
        "service.name": "my-service-name",
    }
)

reader = PrometheusMetricReader()
metrics.set_meter_provider(
    MeterProvider(resource=resource, metric_readers=[reader])
)

start_http_server(port=9464)
```

You can now see the metrics at `http://localhost:9464/metrics` (make sure that your Python program keeps running), after this you can setup your Prometheus server to scrape this endpoint.


### Queuing

- Video: There is no reason to publish old video. So you want to cap the queue to x latest frames
- Audio: Writing faster than 1x causes audio glitches. So we need a queue.
- Audio: Writing slower than 1x also causes glitches. You need to write 0 frames
- Audio generated by LLM: The LLM -> TTS can generate a lot of audio. This has to be stopped when interrupt happens
- Gemini & Google generate at what pace?

### Tasks

- Short running tasks should check if the connection is closed before doing work
- Long running tasks are should be cancelled when calling agent.close()

### Video Frames & Tracks

- Track.recv errors will fail silently. The API is to return a frame. Never return None. and wait till the next frame is available
- When using frame.to_ndarray(format="rgb24") specify the format. Typically you want rgb24 when connecting/sending to Yolo etc


## Onboarding Plan for new contributors

**Audio Formats**

You'll notice that audio comes in many formats. PCM, wav, mp3. 16khz, 48khz. 
Encoded as i16 or f32. Note that webrtc by default is 48khz.

A good first intro to audio formats can be found here:

**Using Cursor**

You can ask cursor something like "read @ai-plugin and build me a plugin called fish"
See the docs folder for other ai instruction files

**Learning Roadmap**

1. Quick refresher on audio formats
2. Build a TTS integration
3. Build a STT integration
4. Build an LLM integration
5. Write a pytest test with a fixture
