# Video/Vision Agents by Stream

Video/Vision AI agents on [Stream's edge network](https://getstream.io/video/).

-  **Low Latency**: Quickly join (500ms) and fast audio latency (30ms)
-  **Video AI**: Built for real-time video AI. Combine Yolo, Roboflow and others with realtime models
-  **Open**: Built by Stream, but use any video edge network that you like
-  **Video / Voice & Chat**: Conversation history, turn keeping in addition to video AI

Open Agent library. Goal is to support most of our video/audio competitors. (See adding support section)
SDKs for React, Android, iOS, Flutter, React, React Native and Unity.

## Examples

### Cluely example

Listen to voice but don't respond. Show suggestions as text/chat

Demo video

### Golf Coaching Example

Use Yolo to determine body position. Share this with gemini for live coaching.

### Dota Coaching Example

Use API calls to retrieve game state, while also analysing the gameplay. 
OpenAI + API calls.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies using uv
uv add openai python-dotenv stream_agents

# Or with pip
pip install openai python-dotenv stream_agents
```

## ⚡ Quick Start - Cluely style AI

```python
from agents import Agent

# Roboflow for object detection (finetuned)
# load docs from @ai-dota-coaching.md
# use speech to speech (STS) gemini model
agent = Agent(
    pre_processors=[Roboflow(), dota_api("gameid")],
    interval=1 second,
    llm=GeminiSTS(), 
    # turn_detection=your_turn_detector
)

# Join a Stream video call
await agent.join(call)

# gemini is available at
agent.llm.client

# history at
agent.conversation
```




## ⚡ Quick Start - Video AI Coach

```python
from agents import Agent

# Roboflow for object detection (finetuned)
# load docs from @ai-dota-coaching.md
# use speech to speech (STS) gemini model
agent = Agent(
    pre_processors=[Roboflow(), dota_api("gameid")],
    interval=1 second,
    llm=GeminiSTS(), 
    # turn_detection=your_turn_detector
)

# Join a Stream video call
await agent.join(call)
```

## Video Transform

Roboflow server side transform of video


```python
from agents import Agent


# Create an agent with the exact syntax you requested
agent = Agent(
    video_transformer=RoboflowTransform() # transform live video from python (instead of on-device). use for AI avatars
)

# Join a Stream video call
await agent.join(call)
```

## Quick Example - Voice AI (TTS, STT) and STS

```python
from agents import Agent
from models import OpenAILLM

# Create an AI model
llm = OpenAILLM(
    api_key="<your-api-key>",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there"},
    ],
    default_temperature=0.8,
)

# Create an agent with the exact syntax you requested
agent = Agent(
    stt=your_stt_service,
    pre_processors=[Roboflow()],
    llm=llm,
    tts=your_tts_service,
    turn_detection=your_turn_detector
)

sts_model = OpenAIRealtime(
    api_key="<your-api-key>",
    model="gpt-4o-realtime-preview",
    voice="Pluck"
)
speechToSpeechAgent = Agent(
    sts=sts_model,
)

# Join a Stream video call
await agent.join(call)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
# Stream API (required)
STREAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
STREAM_API_SECRET=your_stream_api_secret
EXAMPLE_BASE_URL=https://pronto-staging.getstream.io

# ElevenLabs TTS (for voice examples)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key

# OpenAI (for AI model examples)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **`agents/`** - Agent framework and protocols
- **`models/`** - AI model implementations (OpenAI, extensible to others)
- **`examples/`** - Working examples and demos
- **`tests/`** - Comprehensive test suite

### Agent System

```python
agent = Agent(
    tools=[external_api_tool],           # External API integrations
    pre_processors=[data_processor],     # Input data processing  
    llm=ai_model,                      # AI model for responses
    stt=speech_to_text,                  # Speech recognition
    tts=text_to_speech,                  # Voice synthesis
    turn_detection=turn_detector         # Conversation management
)
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test suites
pytest tests/test_agent.py -v

## 🤝 Dev Guidelines

### Light wrapping

AI is changing daily. This makes it important to use light wrapping. IE

```python
tts = ElevenLabsTTS(client=ElevenLabsClient())
```

Note how the ElevenLabsTTS handles standardization.
But if the init for ElevenLabsClient changes, nothing breaks.
If features are added to the client, you can use them easily via tts.client

### Typing

Avoid using Union types or complicated composite types.
Keep typing simple. Use the PcmAudio type instead of bytes when passing around audio.
This prevents mistakes related to different audio formats. 


## Observability

- Traces and metrics go to Prometheus and OpenTelemetry
- Metrics on performance of TTS, STT, LLM, Turn detection and connection to realtime edge.
- Integration with external LLM observability solutions

## Inspiration

- Livekit Agents: Great syntax, Livekit only
- Pipecat: Flexible, but more verbose. Open, we will add support for Stream
- OpenAI Agents: Focused on openAI only, but we will try to add support

## Stream Agents or Proxy

The proxy mode which handles the openAI/Stream connection is a good option if you don't need to run any additional AI models.
If all you need is low latency integration between stream and openAI, that's a good option.
It's available for JS & Python.
