    Regression test for screenshare republishing bug.
    
    Bug: When a user stopped and restarted screensharing, the second TrackAddedEvent
    was not emitted, so the agent couldn't switch back to the screenshare.
    
    Fix: stream_edge_transport._on_track_published() now emits TrackAddedEvent even
    when the track_key already exists in _track_map.
